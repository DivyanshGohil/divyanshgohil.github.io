# 🛡️ Building Blue Team Home Lab - Part 4 : DFIR

Welcome to **Part 4** of the Blue Team Home Lab series! In this section, we’ll be setting up a **DFIR (Digital Forensics and Incident Response)** VM using [**Tsurugi Linux**](https://tsurugi-linux.org/) — a feature-rich and powerful distro designed for digital forensics.

> 🔥 **Note:** This guide focuses on environment setup. You are encouraged to explore the tools and techniques yourself.

## 🖥️ What We’ve Done So Far

In [Part 3](https://divyanshgohil.github.io/2025/03/14/Building-Blue-Team-Home-Lab-Part-3.html), we deployed our first VM — a **firewall**. We:
- Configured VLANs
- Set up DNS & DHCP
- Created basic firewall rules

Now, it’s time to **expand our security team** by introducing the **DFIR machine**, among others.

## 🧰 Why Tsurugi?

While **SANS SIFT Workstation** is a popular choice, we’ve selected **Tsurugi Linux** for:
- Lightweight **MATE desktop environment**
- Unique toolset
- Aesthetic samurai vibes 🇯🇵

> ⚖️ Try both Tsurugi and SIFT. Use what feels right.

## 📡 Network Topology Overview

The **DFIR VM** will:
- Access the **internet** for updates, OSINT, downloads
- Access **Corporate LAN** for log collection
- Be isolated from general internal access (**one-way access**)

---

## 🛠️ Tsurugi Installation Steps

### 1. Download and Import OVA
- Get the OVA from the [official site](https://tsurugi-linux.org/)
- Import it into **VMWare** or **VirtualBox**

### 2. VM Settings
- CPU: 4 Cores (2 processors × 2 cores)
- Network Adapter: Assign to **VLAN 50** (e.g., `vmnet50`)

### 3. First Boot
- Username: `tsurugi`
- Password: `tsurugi`

> 🖼️ Enjoy the samurai-themed desktop!

# 🧰 DFIR VM Setup Guide

This section covers **hostname configuration**, **network settings**, **tool installation**, and **browser enhancements** for your DFIR virtual machine.

---

## 🖥️ Hostname Setup

### 🛠️ Edit `/etc/hosts`

```bash
127.0.0.1   localhost
10.0.50.44  dfir dfir.cyber.hub
```
## 🌐 Static IP & Host Override

> Go to: System > Preferences > Internet and Network > Advanced Network Configuration

### 🛠️ Configure the following:

- **Static IP**
- **Gateway**
- **DNS**
- **Search domain**

> 🔄 **Reboot your VM** after completing this configuration to apply changes.

---

## 🔐 Firewall DNS Resolver Host Override (pfsense VM)

> Navigate to: Services > DNS Resolver > General Settings
### ➕ Under **Host Overrides**, click **Add** and enter:

- **Host:** `dfir`
- **Domain:** `cyber.hub`
- **IP Address:** `10.0.50.44`

> 🧪 Use the firewall’s **Diagnostics > Ping** tool to verify that the FQDN resolves correctly.

## 💾 Snapshot Reminder

📸 **Create a VM snapshot now!**  
It will serve as your rollback point in case you break something or need to revert to a clean, functional state.
