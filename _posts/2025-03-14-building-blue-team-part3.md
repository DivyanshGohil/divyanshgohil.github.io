## Introduction
Welcome to Part 3 of my Blue Team Home Lab series! In this post, we’ll dive into the **firewall** setup and configuration for our network.

> ### Changes to be Done in Previous Setup  
> 1 - Corrected Outbound rules; interface for source `10.0.20.0/24` should be `CORPORATE_LAN_VLAN20`.  
> 2 - Disabled DHCP service; domain controller now provides DHCP.  
> 3 - Added VLAN 99 for malware analysis.

## Firewall: pfSense  

We’ll use **pfSense** - an open source, powerful firewall suitable for both lab and production use.

### VM Specifications  
- **CPU:** 1  
- **RAM:** 512MB  
- **HDD:** 30GB  
- **NICs:** 6  
  - Bridged  
  - vmnet1 (Management)  
  - vmnet10 (Corporate WAN)  
  - vmnet20 (Corporate LAN)  
  - vmnet50 (Security)  
  - vmnet99 (Isolation)  

> **Why 6 NICs?**  
One per VLAN, plus one bridged interface to provide outbound traffic for Security VLAN.

---

## Installation  

Install pfSense using default settings. Once booted:  
1. Configure WAN & Management interfaces (CLI).  
2. Use the table below for IP assignment:

| Interface        | IP Address        |
|------------------|------------------|
| WAN              | 192.168.1.50/24  |
| Management       | 10.0.1.50/24     |
| Corporate WAN    | 10.0.10.254/24   |
| Corporate LAN    | 10.0.20.254/24   |
| Security         | 10.0.50.254/24   |
| Isolation LAN    | 10.0.99.254/24   |

>  WAN subnet depends on your actual ISP network (commonly 192.168.1.0/24 or 192.168.0.0/24).

---

## Configuration  

### Interfaces  
1. Navigate to `Interfaces > Interface Assignments`  
2. Add all NICs, save.  
3. Enable and set for each:  
   - **Description:** `$NETWORK_NAME_VLAN<VLAN_ID>`  
   - **Static IP** from table above (/24)  
   - **Only WAN** should have Upstream Gateway, Block Private & Bogon networks.

---

### Basic Setup  
Go to `System > General Setup`  
- **Hostname:** firewall  
- **Domain:** cyber.hub  
- **DNS Servers:** 9.9.9.9, 1.1.1.1 *(or 8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4)*  
- **Timezone:** Etc/UTC  
- **Theme:** Your preference  

Then, in `System > Advanced > Admin Access`:  
- **Protocol:** HTTPS  
- **Enable Secure Shell**

---

## Firewall Rules  

> Start with allowing all traffic, then gradually restrict based on your lab requirements.

### WAN (`192.168.1.50/24`)  
-  Block Private & Bogon networks (default)  
-  No inbound from internal VLANs unless explicitly required

#### MANAGEMENT (`10.0.1.50/24`)  
-  Access from local machine (vmnet1)  
-  Anti-lockout rule (default)  
-  Disable default IPv6 pass rule  
-  No access from other VLANs (Security, Isolation, etc.)

#### CORPORATE WAN (`10.0.10.254/24`)  
-  Allow from Corporate LAN (`10.0.20.0/24`)  
-  Outbound access to fake WAN or internet  
-  Deny from Security and Isolation VLANs

#### CORPORATE LAN (`10.0.20.254/24`)  
-  Allow to Corporate WAN (`10.0.10.0/24`)  
-  Allow to Management (`10.0.1.0/24`)  
-  Deny to WAN and Security by default  
-  Block traffic to Isolation VLAN
  
#### SECURITY (`10.0.50.254/24`)  
-  Allow to Corporate LAN (`10.0.20.0/24`)  
-  Allow to Isolation VLAN (`10.0.99.0/24`)  
-  Deny to WAN, Management, Corporate WAN  
-  Block all unnecessary outbound unless via VPN

#### ISOLATION (`10.0.99.254/24`)  
-  Deny to all other VLANs  
-  Optional: Allow only logging or update servers  
-  Add explicit deny rule for extra safety

### Outbound NAT Rules  

Set NAT rules at `Firewall > NAT > Outbound`:

| Source VLAN           | Destination        | NAT Interface              |
|-----------------------|--------------------|----------------------------|
| `10.0.50.0/24`        | Internet           | WAN                        |
| `10.0.20.0/24`        | 10.0.10.254 (Fake) | CORPORATE_LAN_VLAN20       |
| `10.0.99.0/24`        | ✖️ (No Internet)    | N/A (Blocked)              |

> Double-check interface bindings in the Outbound NAT tab—make sure, for example, `CORPORATE_LAN_VLAN20` is used correctly instead of defaulting to WAN.

## Summary  

We've deployed a pfSense firewall, created VLAN rules, assigned IPs, and set up access. With traffic control in place, we're ready to move on to **building our security environment** in the next part. Stay tuned!
