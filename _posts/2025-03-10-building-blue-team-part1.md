## Introduction
Welcome to the first part of my Blue Team Home Lab series! This guide is for anyone who wants to build a hands-on virtual cybersecurity lab without spending a fortune.

---

## Why Build a Home Lab?

Like many others, Iâ€™ve used platforms like TryHackMe and Hack The Box, which are awesome but they donâ€™t allow for open-ended experimentation. I wanted something where I could freely explore, test tools, break things, and fix them again. Iâ€™ve built everything **virtually on my PC**, saving money and adding flexibility.

---

## My PC Setup

Hereâ€™s the hardware Iâ€™m using to run the lab:

- **CPU**: IntelÂ® Coreâ„¢ i7-10700 Ã— 16
- **RAM**: 32GB (2x16GB ADATA 3200MHz)
- **Storage**: 512GB SSD
- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS

> **Tip**: If youâ€™re using a laptop, prioritize a strong CPU. RAM and SSD are easy to upgrade, but CPU isnâ€™t.

## Tools Weâ€™ll Use

Below are the main tools and platforms Iâ€™ll use in this series:

- **VMware Workstation Pro** - My go to for managing VMs  
  *Alternative: [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) (Free and reliable)*

- **[draw.io](https://draw.io/)** - For designing network topologies and architecture

- **Virtual Machines** - Including:
  - `pfSense` - Firewall/router
  - `REMnux` - Malware analysis
  - `Tsurugi` - DFIR & forensic analysis
  - *(...more VMs to be added over time)*

---

## Whatâ€™s Next?

In the next part of this series, weâ€™ll:

- Define our labâ€™s **network requirements**
- Select our initial set of **virtual machines**
- Design our **first network topology** to use as a foundation

Stay tuned and feel free to fork this project or contribute your own ideas!
