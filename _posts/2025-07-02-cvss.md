## Introduction
<p>In today's digital world, cybersecurity vulnerabilities are constant challenge. To effectively manage these risks, organizations need a standardized
way to assess the severity of vulnerabilities. The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is the industry standard, providing a simple yet 
powerful way to score vulnerabilities and prioritize remediation efforts.</p>

## What is CVSS
<p>The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is a standardized framework used to measure the severity of security vulnerabilities in software or hardware. It provides a numeric score ranging from 0 to 10 to represent the severity of a vulnerability, and is used by organizations to prioritize security fixes based on the impact of vulnerability.</p>

### CVSS Framework Components
**CVSS v4** is composed of four metric groups. Each consisting of a set of metrics, as shown in below figure.

### Nomenclature

| CVSS Nomenclature | CVSS Metrics Used |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| CVSS-B            | Base Metrics      |
| CVSS-BE           | Base and Environmental Metrics|
| CVSS-BT           | Base and Threat Metrics |
| CVSS-BTE          | Base, Threat and Environmental Metrics |

### Base Metrics

The Base Metrics define the fundamental characteristics of a vulnerability. These factors remain constant across time and environments and form the primary basis for the CVSS score. The key base metrics include:

- **Attack Vector (AV):**
  Describes how the vulnerability is exploited.

  - Network (N): Exploited remotely over the internet.
  - Local (L): Exploited locally (requires access to the affected machine).
  - Adjacent Network (A): Exploited within the local network.
  - Physical (P): Requires physical access to the device.
<br>

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**
  Measures how difficult it is to successfully exploit the vulnerability.

  - Low (L): Exploiting the vulnerability is easy.
  - High (H): Exploiting the vulnerability requires a skilled attacker or special conditions.
<br>

- **Privileges Required (PR):**
  Describes the level of privileges an attacker needs to exploit the vulnerability.

  - None (N): No privileges needed.
  - Low (L): Attacker needs low-level privileges (e.g., user-level access).
  - High (H): Attacker needs administrative or root-level access.
<br>
  Examples:

- **User Interaction (UI):**
  Whether the vulnerability requires user action (e.g., clicking a link, downloading a file).

  - None (N): No user interaction needed.
  - Passive (P): Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires limited interaction by the targeted user with the vulnerable system and the attacker’s payload.
  - Active (A): Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires a targeted user to perform specific, conscious interactions with the vulnerable system and the attacker’s payload.
<br>

- **Attack Requirements (AT):**
  This metric captures the prerequisite deployment and execution conditions or variables of the vulnerable system that enable the attack.

  - None (N): The successful attack does not depend on the deployment and execution conditions of the vulnerable system.
  - Present (P): The successful attack depends on the presence of specific deployment and execution conditions of the vulnerable system that enable the attack.
<br>

- **Impact Metrics:**
  These measure the damage or effect on the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system or subsequent system.

  - Confidentiality (C): The impact on the confidentiality of data (e.g., whether an attacker can view sensitive information).
  - Integrity (I): The impact on the integrity of the system (e.g., whether an attacker can alter data).
  - Availability (A): The impact on the system’s availability (e.g., whether the attacker can crash or disable the system).

## How CVSS Score is Calculated

- The CVSS score is calculated based on the combination of Base Metrics, Threat Metrics, and Environmental Metrics. The Base Metrics contribute the most to the overall score, and other metrics can adjust this score based on the context.

- The result is a score between 0.0 and 10.0, where higher scores indicate more critical vulnerabilities.

- All CVSS scores regardless of nomenclature can be mapped to the qualitative ratings defined in below Table:

| Rating | CVSS Score|
|--------|-----------|
| None   | 0.0       |
| Low    | 0.1 - 3.9 |
| Medium | 4.0 - 6.9 |
| High   | 7.0 - 8.9 |
| Critical | 9.0 - 10 |


## Sample Interview Questions and Answers

**1) What is CVSS and why is it important?**

- CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) is a standardized framework used to assess the severity of vulnerabilities in software. It helps security professionals prioritize vulnerabilities by assigning a numeric score (0 to 10). The higher the score, the more severe the vulnerability. This helps organizations address critical security issues first, optimizing resource allocation for patching or mitigating vulnerabilities.


**2) What is the role of 'Privileges Required' in CVSS?**

- "Privileges Required" measures the level of access or privileges needed by an attacker to exploit the vulnerability. The higher the privileges required (e.g., administrative access), the lower the CVSS score. Vulnerabilities that require no privileges are more dangerous, hence a higher CVSS score.

**3) How does the CVSS score change based on 'User Interaction'?**

- If a vulnerability requires user interaction (e.g., opening a file or clicking a link), it typically lowers the CVSS score. However, if no user interaction is required, the score will be higher, indicating a more severe vulnerability.

**4) What is the 'Exploit Code Maturity' in CVSS, and how does it affect the score?**

- This Threat metric measures the availability of working exploit code for the vulnerability. If exploit code is readily available or widely used, the CVSS score will be higher, reflecting a greater immediate threat.

**5) What are the limitations of the CVSS?**

- CVSS tells you how severe a vulnerability is, but it doesn’t measure risk in your specific environment.
- CVSS was originally built for traditional systems (like servers), so it works well for those. But it’s not always accurate for newer technologies like IoT devices or Cloud environments.
